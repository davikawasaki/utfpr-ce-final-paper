# Computing Exam Questions Classification Using Natural-Language Processing
## UTFPR Computer Engineering Final Project [WIP]

The delay on curricular education models have been discussed and questioned. These questionings aim to meet demands that help and motivate students in the comprehension of subjects with high information quantity. Disruptive, innovative, unorthodox approaches and adaptative teaching have been presented as alternatives for studentsâ€™ academic achievement improvements. Through technologies, such as data mining, these initiatives can get a broader impact, though still without a focused approach to certain knowledge areas. Therefore, this work proposes the development of a computing exam questions classification system, using techniques such as natural-language processing and machine learning.
